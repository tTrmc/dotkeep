### Highlights

#### **Recursive Directory Support**

- Add all dotfiles in a directory and its subdirectories with `dotkeep add <dir>`
- Use `--no-recursive` to restrict to top-level dotfiles only

#### **Tracked Directories & Watcher**

- Only explicitly added directories are monitored for new dotfiles
- `dotkeep watch` automatically adds new dotfiles created in tracked directories

#### **Diagnostics**

- New `dotkeep diagnose` command checks for common setup and git issues, providing actionable guidance

- Improved error messages for common git issues (e.g., divergent branches, missing upstream, rejected pushes)
- Upstream branch is set automatically on first push if needed

#### **Improved CLI Experience**

- `--quiet` flag suppresses output for scripting and automation
- `--push` flag available for `add`, `delete`, and `restore` to immediately push changes
- `dotkeep version` displays the current version
- `dotkeep --install-completion` enables shell tab-completion for all commands and options

#### **Commit Efficiency**

- Adding multiple dotfiles in a directory now results in a single commit, improving repository clarity

### Improvements & Fixes

- Robust handling of symlinks and prevention of watcher loops
- Tracked directories are automatically removed from tracking when all dotfiles inside are deleted
- Consistent, user-friendly CLI output
- Expanded and improved test suite for CLI and core logic

## [0.1.0] - First Public Release

### dotkeep is a minimal, Git-backed dotfiles manager for Linux

This is the first public release.

### Features

- **Easy setup:**
  Initialize your dotfiles repo with `dotkeep init`.
  The Git repository is stored in `~/.dotkeep/repo`.

- **Git-based versioning:**
  All changes are tracked with Git.
  Supports local history, branching, and remote sync.

- **Add and remove dotfiles:**
  - `dotkeep add <file>`: Copies a file into the repo, commits it, and symlinks it from your home directory.
  - `dotkeep delete <file>`: Removes the symlink and the file from the repo and Git.

- **Symlink management:**
  Automatically replaces managed files in `$HOME` with symlinks to the repo.

- **Status overview:**
  `dotkeep status` shows untracked, modified, and staged files in your dotkeep repo.

- **Remote sync:**
  - `dotkeep push`: Push all local commits to your remote.
  - `dotkeep pull`: Pull and merge changes from your remote.

- **Restore files:**
  `dotkeep restore <file>`: Re-create the symlink for a managed file if it's missing.

- **List tracked files:**
  `dotkeep list-files`: See all files currently managed by dotkeep.
